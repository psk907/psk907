### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### If you're here and don't know me yet, then here's a few !(fun) facts about me - 
I'm a Computer Science Undergrad entering my 2nd year at Ramaiah Institute of Technology.
Yeah, ofcourse I code, but what I find even more fun is making apps.
I use Flutter for my work, and if you don't, you really should give it a shot.

Right now I'm working with my team - Statefully Fidgeting on a game, called 'Tug of War'. Find it on the Play Store later this month.ðŸ¤ 

If you want to chat, hit me up on my insta @psk907.
