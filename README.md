### Hi there 👋

#### If you're here and don't know me yet, then here's a few !(fun) facts about me - 
🎓 I'm a Computer Science Undergrad entering my 2nd year at Ramaiah Institute of Technology.

💻 Yeah, of course I code, but what I find even more fun is making apps.
I use Flutter for my work, and if you don't, you really should give it a shot.

🎮 Right now I'm working with my team - [Statefully Fidgeting](github.com/statefully-fidgeting) on a game, called 'Tug of War'.  Find it on the Play Store later this month.🤠

🗣 If you want to chat, [hit me up](https://www.instagram.com/psk_907/).
